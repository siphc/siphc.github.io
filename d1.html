this is a story</br>
of something extraordinary</br>
that happened to me</br>
</br>
we start at the entrance of a tunnel</br>
too dark to see, too long to feel</br>
whence we came,</br>
and where do we aim?</br>
is it real,</br>
is it all the same?</br>
</br>
the curious reader may ask</br>
"wherefore you travel,"</br>
"what lies at the end of the tunnel?"</br>
for once, that i know the answer to!</br>
for once, i know what i pursue</br>
the journey has a purpose</br>
and i wish to share it with you.</br>
</br>
<hr>
</br>
<h3>?</br></h3>
it's here again</br>
it's back here again</br>
all the initial optimism</br>
they've gone away <small>(so eager to leave, they are!)</small></br>
</br>
i'm scared again</br>
of the same thing, again</br>
all those years of trying</br>
my efforts in vain</br>
</br>
some things just stay the same</br>
who else have i to blame?</br>
or had i not tried at all</br>
would anything've been different at all?</br>
</br>
where lies our future? <small>(i wonder.)</small></br>
where will we be? <small>(i wonder.)</small></br>
where are the skills that keep us living? <small>(we... i wonder.)</small></br>
if everything ends tomorrow,</br>
will you still stay close to me?</br>
or will you be overwhelmed</br>
do you even know?</br>
</br>
a day passed by</br>
and another one too</br>
have we been here before?</br>
watching everything fade</br>
while we can only pray?</br>
</br>
a week passed by</br>
and another--no, not yet</br>
have we been here before?</br>
</br>
so many questions,</br>
too little answers!</br>
i don't want to be in the tunnel</br>
i want to know</br>
i want to feel</br>
i want to ask, dear devil,</br>
where must i go</br>
to unseal your deal?</br>
imagine, dear reader,</br>
one last answer</br>
and no more questions!</br>

<h3>starvation in abundance</br></h3>
last night i spent all my time chasing a high</br>
and the night before that,</br>
and the one before that too</br>
</br>
it's no ordinary drug, you see</br>
ever since i started on this journey</br>
i've been alone, isolated</br>
no place to go, no house to safely call home</br>
</br>
and so i reach out to you</br>
my relief, immaterial</br>
"i love you"</br>
and i found that hard to believe</br>
</br>
can't you see my sorry state?</br>
can't you see my unavailability?</br>
can't you see that i do this</br>
over and over</br>
and over and over</br>
and over again?</br>
</br>
i tell myself</br>
"you don't live in a vacuum"</br>
and you tell me</br>
in your soft voice that i can only imagine</br>
"it's okay to ask for the things you want"</br>
and i found that hard to believe</br>
</br>
perhaps i'm actually regressing</br>
perhaps i increasingly find it harder</br>
and harder and harder</br>
to believe in you</br>
in everyone else</br>
even in the words that i say myself</br>
</br>
it's not a fair game, you see!</br>
i say, "christ, she's helpless"</br>
truth, gospel, verity <small>(is it?)</small></br>
you say, "the human experience is complex"</br>
sure, i reply</br>
"you're absolutely right"</br>
but what about the other thing?</br>
and the other and the other and</br>
a million different thoughts and worries and impulses i have thought</br>
to be long gone</br>
lost to the depths of my memories</br>
they all come out</br>
all at once</br>
like fish in a rainy day</br>
if i am indeed complex</br>
it must owe itself to the complexity of my anxiety!</br>
and so i bring them to you, one by one,</br>
you say, "it's okay to ask for things"</br>
"truth", i repeat to myself</br>
since repetition is such a good weapon</br>
you say, "it's okay to be lonely and stressed"</br>
"gospel", i repeat to myself</br>
since repetition is such a good tool</br>
you say, "good things come to people who wait"</br>
"verity", i repeat to myself</br>
since repetition has served me well</br>
</br>
and so it goes again</br>
tolerance, the same hit</br>
until words have lost all their meaning</br>
the same words and the same voice and the same actions</br>
diminishes and diminishes</br>
until they have all lost their meaning</br>
and i curl up in a corner, crying out</br>
"will anyone please think of poor me</br>
is anyone there, will anyone care?"</br>
unable to parse that i'm surrounded by love</br>

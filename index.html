<h1>witness peak web design!</h1>
<p>there's a certain charm in the design philosophy of <a href=https://www.illwinter.com>the team behind CoE 5</a>, whose website is stable, lightweight, and loads perfectly even in pre-alpha browsers like <a href=https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird>Ladybird</a>. ideally, most of the web should consist of converted extended markdown documents - because that's all you need.</p>

<p>the practice of putting too many things on one's personal page, aside from the bare minimum and for professional reasons (<a href=https://angelhof.github.io>a good example</a>), is a bit silly: if you want to know more about me, let's chat in person, or even online if the former isn't feasible. <a href=https://stallman.org>Richard Stallman's website</a>, for example, is utterly detestable for many reasons, among which is the sheer amount of content.</p>

<br><blockquote>Are you quite sure that all those bells and whistles, all those wonderful facilities of your so called powerful programming languages, belong to the solution set rather than the problem set?<p>- Edsger W. Dijkstra</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote>It has often been suggested that 1,000 lines of code represents the practical limit in size for a program which is to be understood and maintained by a single individual. Most operating systems either exceed this limit by one or even two orders of magnitude...<p>- <a href=https://cs3210.cc.gatech.edu/r/unix6.pdf>John Lions, 1977</a></p></blockquote>
